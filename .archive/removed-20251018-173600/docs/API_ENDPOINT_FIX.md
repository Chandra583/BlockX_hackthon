# API Endpoint Fix for Service Provider Installations

## Issue
The Service Provider Installations page was trying to access the endpoint `/api/service/installs/assigned` which did not exist, resulting in a 404 Not Found error.

## Root Cause
1. The frontend was calling an endpoint that wasn't implemented in the backend
2. The service installs routes only had POST endpoints but no GET endpoint for fetching assigned installations

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Backend Fix
**File**: `backend/src/routes/serviceInstalls.routes.ts`

**Added new GET endpoint**:
```typescript
/**
 * GET /api/service/installs/assigned
 * Get assigned installations for service provider
 * Access: Service provider only
 */
router.get('/installs/assigned', authorize('service'), async (req: any, res: any) => {
  // Implementation that filters installations by authenticated service provider
  // Automatically filters by serviceProviderId = userId
  // Supports optional status filtering and pagination
});
```

**Key Features of the New Endpoint**:
- Secured with service provider authorization
- Automatically filters installations assigned to the authenticated service provider
- Supports optional status filtering via query parameters
- Includes pagination support
- Populates vehicle and owner information
- Returns consistent response format matching other API endpoints

### 2. Frontend Fix
**File**: `frontend/src/services/serviceInstalls.ts`

**Updated API endpoint URL**:
```typescript
// Before
const url = `/installs/devices${queryParams.toString() ? `?${queryParams.toString()}` : ''}`;

// After
const url = `/service/installs/assigned${queryParams.toString() ? `?${queryParams.toString()}` : ''}`;
```

### 3. How It Works

**Request Flow**:
1. Frontend calls `ServiceInstallsService.getAssignedInstallations()`
2. This makes a GET request to `/api/service/installs/assigned`
3. Backend authenticates the user and verifies they have service provider role
4. Backend filters Install documents where `serviceProviderId` matches the authenticated user's ID
5. Results are paginated and vehicle/owner data is populated
6. Response is returned in the standard API format

**Authentication & Authorization**:
- Route is protected by `authenticate` middleware (JWT required)
- Route is protected by `authorize('service')` middleware (service provider role required)
- Automatically filters results by authenticated user's ID

**Response Format**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Installations retrieved successfully",
  "data": {
    "installations": [
      {
        "id": "string",
        "vehicleId": "string",
        "ownerId": "string",
        "serviceProviderId": "string",
        "status": "assigned",
        "deviceId": "string",
        "requestedAt": "ISO8601 timestamp",
        "assignedAt": "ISO8601 timestamp",
        "startedAt": "ISO8601 timestamp",
        "completedAt": "ISO8601 timestamp",
        "notes": "string",
        "priority": "medium",
        "initialMileage": 12345,
        "solanaTx": "string",
        "arweaveTx": "string",
        "history": [],
        "vehicle": {
          "vin": "string",
          "vehicleNumber": "string",
          "make": "string",
          "vehicleModel": "string",
          "year": 2020,
          "lastVerifiedMileage": 12345
        },
        "owner": {
          "firstName": "string",
          "lastName": "string",
          "email": "string"
        }
      }
    ],
    "total": 1,
    "page": 1,
    "limit": 20,
    "totalPages": 1
  }
}
```

## Testing
The fix has been tested to ensure:
1. Endpoint is accessible at `/api/service/installs/assigned`
2. Proper authentication and authorization are enforced
3. Results are correctly filtered by service provider
4. Pagination works correctly
5. Vehicle and owner data is properly populated
6. Response format matches frontend expectations

## Files Modified
1. `backend/src/routes/serviceInstalls.routes.ts` - Added GET endpoint
2. `frontend/src/services/serviceInstalls.ts` - Updated endpoint URL

This fix resolves the 404 error and provides the service provider installation functionality as originally intended.
