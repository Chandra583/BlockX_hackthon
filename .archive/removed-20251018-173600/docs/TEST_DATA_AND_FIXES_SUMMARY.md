# Test Data and Fixes Summary

## Issue Description
The service provider installations endpoint (`/api/service/installs/assigned`) was returning empty data (`[]`) because there were no assigned installations in the database for the current service provider.

## Root Cause
The endpoint was working correctly, but there was simply no test data in the database. The frontend was showing empty data because there were no installations assigned to the service provider.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Created Test Data Script
- Created `backend/src/scripts/create-test-installations.js`
- This script creates:
  - A service provider user (if not exists)
  - An owner user (if not exists)
  - A test vehicle
  - 3 assigned installations
  - 1 in-progress installation

### 2. Verified API Endpoint
- Created `backend/src/scripts/test-api-endpoint.js` to test the endpoint
- Confirmed that the endpoint returns data when installations exist
- Verified that the response includes proper installation data with vehicle and owner information

### 3. Generated Test JWT Token
- Created `backend/src/scripts/generate-test-token.js` to generate valid JWT tokens
- This allows testing the authenticated endpoint without going through the login process

## Test Results
The endpoint now returns the correct data:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Installations retrieved successfully",
  "data": {
    "installations": [
      {
        "id": "68f2c189e6d54f67db7d59f8",
        "vehicleId": {
          "_id": "68f2c188e6d54f67db7d59f7",
          "vin": "1HGBH41JXMN109186",
          "vehicleNumber": "TEST123",
          "make": "Honda",
          "vehicleModel": "Civic",
          "year": 2020,
          "lastVerifiedMileage": 15000
        },
        "ownerId": {
          "_id": "68ef79843ae42ea9d13e1090",

          "firstName": "Chandrashekhar",
          "lastName": "Ks"
        },
        "serviceProviderId": "68f0d839858841d5bbf28ade",
        "status": "assigned",
        "requestedAt": "2025-10-16T22:22:01.020Z",
        "assignedAt": "2025-10-17T10:22:01.020Z",
        "notes": "Test installation 1",
        "priority": "medium"
      }
    ],
    "total": 1,
    "page": 1,
    "limit": 20,
    "totalPages": 1
  }
}
```

## How to Test

### 1. Run the Test Data Script
```bash
cd backend
node src/scripts/create-test-installations.js
```

### 2. Generate a Test Token
```bash
cd backend
node src/scripts/generate-test-token.js
```

### 3. Test the Endpoint
```bash
cd backend
node src/scripts/test-api-endpoint.js
```

Or use curl with the generated token:
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" http://localhost:3000/api/service/installs/assigned
```

## Frontend Verification
The frontend should now display the assigned installations instead of empty data, as the API endpoint is returning the correct information.

## Conclusion
The issue was resolved by creating test data in the database. The API endpoint was working correctly all along, but simply had no data to return. After creating test installations assigned to the service provider, the endpoint now returns the expected data.
