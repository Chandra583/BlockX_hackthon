# 🔧 Purchase Flow UI Refresh Guide

## 🎯 Issue Identified

The enhanced Purchase Flow UI with detailed step cards and Explorer modal has been implemented, but the frontend may be showing cached content.

## ✅ Solution Steps

### **1. Frontend Refresh Required**
The enhanced UI includes:
- **Grid Layout**: 4 detailed step cards instead of horizontal flow
- **Step Details**: Amount, status, seller info for each step
- **Explorer Button**: Eye icon in progress header
- **Dual Buttons**: "View Explorer" + "My Vehicles" in complete step

### **2. Clear Browser Cache**
1. **Hard Refresh**: Press `Ctrl + F5` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
2. **Clear Cache**: 
   - Open DevTools (`F12`)
   - Right-click refresh button
   - Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

### **3. Verify Backend is Running**
```bash
# Backend should be running on port 3000
# Check: http://localhost:3000/api/health
```

### **4. Expected UI Changes**

#### **Before (Old UI)**
- Simple horizontal flow: Fund → Verify → Transfer → Complete
- Basic step names only
- Single "View in My Vehicles" button

#### **After (Enhanced UI)**
- **Grid Layout**: 4 detailed cards in a row
- **Step 1 Card**: Shows amount (₹12,900) and status
- **Step 2 Card**: Shows trust score (90/100) and verification status
- **Step 3 Card**: Shows seller info and transfer status
- **Step 4 Card**: Shows ownership status
- **Explorer Button**: Eye icon next to "Step 4 of 4"
- **Dual Buttons**: "View Explorer" (blue) + "My Vehicles" (green)

### **5. Test the Explorer Modal**
1. Click the **Eye icon** in the progress header
2. Or click **"View Explorer"** button in complete step
3. Should open large modal with:
   - Transaction Overview (left column)
   - Flow Timeline (right column)
   - Blockchain Details (bottom section)

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### **If UI Still Shows Old Design**
1. **Check Console**: Look for JavaScript errors
2. **Verify Component**: Ensure BuyerPurchaseFlow.tsx is the active component
3. **Check Props**: Verify request data is being passed correctly
4. **Restart Frontend**: Stop and restart the frontend dev server

### **If Explorer Modal Doesn't Open**
1. **Check State**: Verify `showExplorer` state is working
2. **Check Imports**: Ensure all icons are imported correctly
3. **Check Z-index**: Modal should have `z-60` to appear above other content

## 📱 Expected Visual Changes

### **Progress Section**
```
Before: [Fund Escrow] → [Verify] → [Transfer] → [Complete]

After:  [Fund Escrow Card] [Verify Card] [Transfer Card] [Complete Card]
        Amount: ₹12,900    Trust: 90/100  Seller: John   Ownership: ✓
