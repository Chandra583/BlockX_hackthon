# Buy Functionality Debug & Fix Report

## Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. **Empty handleRequestToBuy Function** ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: The `handleRequestToBuy` function in `MarketplaceBrowse.tsx` was empty and not opening the modal.

**Fix**: Updated the function to properly set the selected listing and open the modal:
```typescript
const handleRequestToBuy = (listing: MarketplaceListing) => {
  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    toast.error('Please login to request a purchase');
    return;
  }
  
  // Check if user is trying to buy their own vehicle
  if (user?.id === listing.vehicle.owner.id) {
    toast.error('You cannot purchase your own vehicle');
    return;
  }
  
  setSelectedListing(listing);
  setShowRequestModal(true);
};
```

### 2. **Wrong ID Parameter** ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: The API was passing `listing.id` but the backend expects `vehicle.id`.

**Fix**: Updated `RequestBuyModal.tsx` to use the correct vehicle ID:
```typescript
await MarketplaceAPI.requestToBuy({
  listingId: listing.vehicle.id, // Changed from listing.id
  price: price,
  message: message.trim()
});
```

### 3. **Missing Authentication Checks** ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: Buy buttons were visible to everyone, but would fail for unauthenticated users.

**Fix**: Added authentication checks:
- Added `useAppSelector` import for auth state
- Added `isAuthenticated` and `user` from Redux store
- Added authentication check in `handleRequestToBuy`
- Added `showBuyButton` prop to `MarketplaceCard`
- Updated both grid and list views to only show Buy button for authenticated users

### 4. **Self-Purchase Prevention** ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: Users could try to buy their own vehicles.

**Fix**: Added check to prevent self-purchase:
```typescript
if (user?.id === listing.vehicle.owner.id) {
  toast.error('You cannot purchase your own vehicle');
  return;
}
```
