  - `trustscore_changed` → Update VehicleList/Details

- **Frontend Integration**:
  - Real-time counters in DashboardHome
  - Live updates in DevicesList, VehicleDetails, History
  - Socket connection management with authentication

### 5. HISTORY & TELEMETRY PAGE ✅
- **Features**:
  - VIN filter dropdown
